          <h3>Our History</h3>
          <p>
            Tasty Bites was founded in 2025 by a group of passionate chefs with a vision to bring high-quality, flavorful food to the community. Starting as a small pizzeria, we quickly became a local favorite. Over the years, we've expanded our menu to include a wide range of dishes, and we now proudly serve thousands of satisfied customers every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our restaurant has always been a family-owned business, and we take pride in creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere where guests feel like part of our family.
